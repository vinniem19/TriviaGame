# TriviaGame
This will be a trivia game with multiple choice answers, a countdown timer, and at the end a tally of correct/incorrect answers.

In the development of this game, I used HTML and CSS to set up the layout and Javascript to add functionality.  

The user is shown a series of 3 questions.  Each question has a countdown timer displayed.  User will attempt to guess the correct answer in the allotted time.  Answers are displayed in multiple choice format (as buttons).  When a user selects an answer, they will be given a "correct" or "incorrect" with the correct answer shown.  After the completion of the game, the user is able to see how many questions he or she answered correctly.
